## Autonomous Agents

The [Sketch](https://github.com/njw275/Decoding-Nature/blob/master/Autonomous%20Agents/White-sketch-AA.js)

### About

This sketch shows a vehicle, in this case a car, with a steering force. The car is trying to find its end point, and with a low max force the car reaches its parking spot.

## Sound

[p5 Sound Experiment Video](https://vimeo.com/286714860)

The [Sketch](https://github.com/njw275/Decoding-Nature/blob/master/p5-Sound/sketch.js)

### About

This sketch shows the use of the p5 sound library to alter the music, here Chance the Rapper's "Acid Rain". In addition to the music, the sketch displays a sine wave of ellipses that changes its height corresponding to the pitch of the song.

## Cellular Automata

The [Sketch](https://github.com/njw275/Decoding-Nature/blob/master/Cellular%20Automata/Nick-CA-sketch.js)

### About

Here, I created a game of minesweeper where the bombs are placed before the game using the rules of the Game of Life.

## Particle Systems

The [Sketch](https://github.com/njw275/Decoding-Nature/blob/master/Particle%20Systems/White-Assign4-sketch.js)

### About

Collect the particles on the screen with your mouse before the time runs out! The collected particles create a tail on your mouse, and when you stop moving the particles will float around the mouse

## L System

![GIF of L System Sketch](https://github.com/njw275/Decoding-Nature/blob/master/Documentation/grid.gif)

The [Sketch](https://github.com/njw275/Decoding-Nature/blob/master/LSystem/LWhite-sketch.js)

### About

Based on the Lindenmayer System, or L System, this sketch draws based on a set rule system. The L System can be drawn as if a "Turtle" is following the rules to reach different coordinates. This particular rule set I created interested me because it reminds me of a city grid. Ater noticing that, I added the flashing lines in to give it a electricity feel.
